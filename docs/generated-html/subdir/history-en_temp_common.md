//ST: History of Gephi

The origin of Gephi lays in http://webatlas.fr/wp/[Web Atlas], a project started in 2006 involving Mathieu Jacomy, who was interested in the exploration of web-based graphs.
This was about the same time http://www.cond.org/[Eytan Adar] was developing his https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjljNmDtbrRAhXL6xQKHWDdDRMQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgraphexploration.cond.org%2Fchi2006%2Fguess-chi2006.pdf&usg=AFQjCNETmuZqHoaZyJSYpSuTGQ87PNSCLA&sig2=ns0z9wqVRIo5riVtHv1QfQ[GUESS software]

In 2007/2008, this project morphed into Gephi, developed by a team of students at Université Technologique de Compiègne (https://www.utc.fr/en.html[UTC]).

== A series of metrics on Gephi's popularity over time

//ST: !

Gephi has evolved in several major milestones:

- version 0.6 (2009): the initial public release. Contains already the filter system.
- version 0.7 (2010): Major overhaul of the graphics interface. Started using OpenGL framework for graphics acceleration. A system of plugin is created.

//ST: !

- version 0.8 (2011): Introduced dynamic graphs.

2011 to 2016: Many plugins were created for Gephi, and the software started becoming much popular.

Mac computer users had issues installing Gephi on their computers because of a Java compatibility issue.

//ST: !

version 0.9 (December 2015):

- A graph engine optimized for memory is introduced: Gephi can handle much larger graphs.
- The codebase for the project is "mavenized", making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Compatibility issues with Mac OS are solved.

In 2016, Gephi is translated in French, Spanish, Japanese,  Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Czech and German.
